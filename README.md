# Quotation Factory

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository of Quotation Factory, your go-to SaaS platform for streamlined quoting processes. Initially founded in 2019 under the name 'Metal Heaven' with our platform known as "Rhodium24" or "Rh24", we rebranded to Quotation Factory (abbreviated as QF) in January 2022. This move was part of our commitment to better serve our users and align with our strategic vision.

## Historical Context and Naming Conventions

Our platform has undergone significant transformations since its inception. We are in the process of updating the naming conventions in our codebase to reflect the Quotation Factory identity. It's important to note that for compatibility reasons, references to "Rhodium24" or "Rh24" are still present, particularly in our open-source contributions and on-premise solutions. This ensures stability and compatibility for all users relying on older versions.

## Our Goals

We are committed to eventually standardizing the naming across all areas of our codebase. However, due to the strategic allocation of our resources, this update is a gradual process. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to make these improvements.

## Contribution

We highly encourage contributions to our platform. Whether you are fixing bugs, proposing new features, or improving documentation, your help is welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. We look forward to growing together!
