## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Our Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Bug Reports

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. When reporting a bug, include as many details as possible:
- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the issue with that behavior.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Provide as much detail and context as possible.
